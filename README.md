# ISS_LOCATION

This project tracks the current location of the International Space Station (ISS) and at the time point when the ISS is in the night sky, right above where we are, then we send ourselves an email telling us to look up at the sky to try and spot the fast moving ISS.

NOTE: the current latitudes and longitude positions of where we live are hard coded.
